TUTORIAL

Inside the main folder you can find two documentation files, one called "QuickstartGuide.txt" more general about RedCRAB and another one called "Documentation_Cfg.txt" more focus on setting pulses and parameters option. Please read them in order to have a rough idea about how RedCRAB works.

In order to make first steps into RedCrab and check if all settings are correct, I suggest you to run some trivial open-loop optimisations as following:

1) In Config/Client_Config/chopped.txt file set  FOMEvaluation := 0 (this test decouples the experiment and compute the FOM via a test script), modify PyModPath with the correct path. Then, using Cfg_1.txt, run your first optimization.

2) In Config/Client_Config/chopped.txt file set  FOMEvaluation := 2, modify PulsePath and FOMPath with the correct path. In FomTest folder there is a python script called "fom_creation.py" which simulates your experiment: it takes the pulses set from the PulsesTest folder, and computes the figure of merit adding random fluctuations on it. Take a look into the script "fom_creation.py" and modify the paths, and run "fom_creation.py". Finally you should be ready for run your second optimization using for instance Cfg_2.txt .

If all run correctly you should be able to create your Cfg_#.txt file and start with close-loop optimization. Basically "fom_creation.py" should be replaced by your software which takes pulses provided by RedCRAB, inserts them in your experiment, computes figure of merit, and returns it to RedCRAB.

Please don't hesitate to contact me in case you have some questions. Enjoy with RedCrab!
